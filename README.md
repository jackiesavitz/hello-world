This is a practice to learn how to use the features of GitHub

So this is the file to practice figuring out how this thing works.  So far it seems like a complicated version of a file management system that is open for all to view.  Unless I pay for private.  With added ability to allow others to engage and all that. So let's see what more is here. Someday I or someone else will read this and think it's funny.  :)

Interested to see if this at some point becomes a document that looks like something I'd share outside of Github.  And then I'll get on a working Github repository that involves the whole team, and that will be awesome.

Bye for now.
